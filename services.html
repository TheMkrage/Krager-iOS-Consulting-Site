										<h2>Services</h2>
										<p>All advisory services at a fixed rate of $100/hour</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										I started learning about iOS development in 5th grade and have been an active member of the iOS community since then.
										In the industry, I have led the production of several apps and have been involved on new features for apps we use everyday, such as Yelp.
										I have also been awarded Apple's WWDC Developer Scholarship and attended their worldwide conference.
										Creating products for Apple's platforms is quite unique from any other platform.
										My experiences can help you quickly kickstart and improve your app production.
										<br/>Below are the services I offer:

											<h3>Idea Development</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Have the beginnings of an idea for an app?
											I can help you further develop your idea by identifying competition, determining technical feasibility, and connecting you to others in related markets.
											In addition, I can highlight ways to give you a competitive advantage and tell you if something similar has been attempted before.
											I employ this process for every app I build	and would be happy to bring this proven method to you.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											With all of this, you can vet your ideas before you spend any time or resources building a product. I can also help define some clear next steps.
										</p>
									</section>

											<h3>Getting off the Ground</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Confident in your idea and ready to build an app?
											I can give you the best practices for forming and managing an iOS development team, especially for those with non-technical background.
											I can also give tips on finding and evaluating potential hires for iOS development.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											The iOS ecosystem is quite unique and I can help you avoid common pitfalls and save your company hours of time when ramping up development.

											<h3>Starting Development on an existing codebase</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Did your company purchase or outsource an existing app or codebase?
											It can be difficult to navigate and decide on the best next steps.
											I can give you insight on how reliable or secure your codebase is and give you time estimates for adding new features.
											I can also identify and offer solutions for issues that will likely not surface until later in development or in growing your company.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											Ramping up on an existing codebase can be one of the most time consuming processes for companies.
											From my experiences, I can alleviate some of this tedious process for you.
										</p>

											<h3>Posting on the App Store</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Have questions about the process of posting on the App Store?
											There are many guidelines and regulations for what you can and can't do and it's important to know before you spend any unnecessary resources.
											There are also strategies related to pricing models that you can take to ensure your business takes home more from your revenue.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											It is important to understand the regulations of the Apple Ecosystem. Certain strategies could avoid snags from redtape and result in your company receiving 20% more from your revenue.

											<h3>Code Quality Review and Improvement</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Want to gain insight on the long-term health of your codebase? Or just check in on your development team?
											I can score the reliability and security of your codebase as well as suggest proven ways to improve your efficiency in maintaining and developing features.
											<br/>
											<br/>

											<h3>Learning iOS Development</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Do you want to learn how to develop apps?
											I have personally mentored dozens of junior iOS developers and know the most effective and up-to-date resources.
											I would be happy to guide you in learning, resume-building, and iOS side projects.
											I can also give effective pointers in getting involved in the iOS community and passing technical interviews.
